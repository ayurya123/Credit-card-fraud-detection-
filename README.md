Credit card fraud detection is a critical task in the financial industry aimed at identifying fraudulent transactions and preventing unauthorized access to funds. Logistic regression is a popular machine learning algorithm used for binary classification tasks, making it well-suited for detecting fraudulent transactions based on historical transaction data and associated features.

Tech Stack:

1. Python: Python is the primary programming language used for implementing the credit card fraud detection system.
   
2. Scikit-learn: Scikit-learn is a powerful machine learning library in Python that provides efficient implementations of logistic regression and other classification algorithms.
 
3. Pandas: Pandas is used for data manipulation and preprocessing tasks, such as loading and cleaning the transaction dataset.
 
4. Matplotlib and Seaborn: These libraries are used for data visualization to gain insights into the distribution of features and the nature of fraudulent transactions.
  
5. Jupyter Notebook: Jupyter Notebook is an interactive development environment that facilitates exploratory data analysis and model training.
